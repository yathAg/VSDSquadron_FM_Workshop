## Good Schematic Design Practices

- Ensure all ground flags face downward, and power flags face upward for consistency and clarity.
- Extend wires to completely underline their labels. This avoids confusion and improves readability.
- Avoid overlapping labels with components or pin numbers. Use longer wires if necessary to achieve this.
- Use consistent units for components, especially capacitors. For example, choose either 0.1 ÂµF or 100 nF and use it throughout the schematic. This simplifies BOM generation for the fabrication house.
- Generate a color output with the drawing sheet to make it easier for the reader to interpret the schematic.
